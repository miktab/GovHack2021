# To trust or not to trust?

When asked about a sensitive issue, and told "This is an anonymous survey."...

Are you as carefree as bender?

Or as suspicious as Fry?

The issue this Project aims to solve pertains to surveys of sensitive issues on groups of people. Questions like
"Do you think you're smarter than your friends?", "Have you been faithful to your partner?"
Or how about, "have you broken the lock down orders in Melbourne during the past week?"

Can participants really be expected to trust the word of the surveyer, and answer honestly, when the
implications of admission can be so deadly?

# Trust, but Verify
To "trust, buy verify" comes from the rhyming Russian Proverb and is in my opinion a very wise philosophy.

So this weekend I explored 2 methods for the anonymous submission of survey responses that aims to protect the privacy or all participants.

## Method I: Randomised Response

Randomised response is an easy to understand procedure, used in structured survey interviews, to protect the participants responses. 
The methodology comes from the 1965 paper by Warner and is regularly used in surveys about
doping in sports.

## Method II: Secure Multiparty Computation
Secure Multiparty Computation is a subfield of cryptography which aims to compute functions while keeping inputs private.
The methodology comes from the 1989 paper by Ben-Or. M , Goldwasser. S, Wigderson. A
and is one of the most fundamental results of secure computation.

## Conclusion:
Randomised Response and Secure Multiparty Computation both have their place in the area of surveys.

Secure Multiparty computation doesn't add noise but Randomises response does not require long computations.

This project seeks to be an accessible educational resource so people can learn, understand
and verify the methodologies described. Only that way can people understand, rather than be expected to trust, in the privacy 
they are guaranteed with these methods.
